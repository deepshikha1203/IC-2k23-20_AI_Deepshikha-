Unit 1: AI Problem Formulation & Intelligent Problem Solving
1. Vacuum Cleaner Problem
Problem Statement
A simple reflex agent cleans an environment consisting of two rooms (A and B). Each room can be either Clean or Dirty.

Production Rules
Rule 1 (Cleaning): If current room is Dirty 
→
 Action: SUCK.
Rule 2 (Movement A 
→
 B): If current room is A and Clean 
→
 Action: Move RIGHT.
Rule 3 (Movement B 
→
 A): If current room is B and Clean 
→
 Action: Move LEFT.
Learning Takeaways
Demonstrates a pure reflex agent: actions depend solely on the current percept, requiring no past memory.
Ideal for closed, fully observable, static worlds.
2. Water Jug Problem
Problem Statement
Given two jugs of capacities 
X
 and 
Y
 with no measurement markings, measure exactly 
Z
 liters of water.

Solvability Condition
Z
≤
max
(
X
,
Y
)
 and 
Z
(
mod
gcd
(
X
,
Y
)
)
=
0
.

Intuitive Rule Loop
If Jug 1 is empty, fill it.
If Jug 2 is full, empty it.
Otherwise, pour water from Jug 1 into Jug 2 until Jug 2 is full or Jug 1 is exhausted.
Learning Takeaways
Demonstrates deterministic state manipulation where infinite capacity sources and sinks reduce continuous math to discrete steps.
3. Missionaries and Cannibals Problem
Problem Statement
Three missionaries and three cannibals must cross a river using a two-person boat. At no point on either riverbank may cannibals outnumber missionaries (otherwise, missionaries are eaten).

State Representation
State: (M_left, C_left, boat)
M_left: Missionaries on the starting bank (
0
≤
M
l
e
f
t
≤
3
).
C_left: Cannibals on the starting bank (
0
≤
C
l
e
f
t
≤
3
).
boat: 1 if boat is on the left bank, 0 if on the right bank.
Start State: (3, 3, 1)
Goal State: (0, 0, 0)
Safety Invariant
For both sides of the river: 
If 
M
>
0
⟹
M
≥
C

Learning Takeaways
Introduces state constraints and pruning: states that violate safety are discarded immediately.
Breadth-First Search (BFS) guarantees discovering the solution with the minimum number of boat trips (11 crossings).
4. Rule-Based Decision Making
Problem Statement
An automated rule engine checks input symptoms/indicators against pre-programmed IF-THEN rules to classify a condition or issue recommendations.

Working Principle
Knowledge Base: Stores facts and rules.
Inference Engine: Evaluates inputs, tests rule criteria, and triggers actions/conclusions (forward chaining).
Learning Takeaways
Basis of classical expert systems: cleanly separates domain knowledge from the execution engine.
Quick Reference Summary

2. Water Jug	State Simulation	(jug1_amt, jug2_amt)	jug1 == target or jug2 == target	Pour / Fill / Empty cycle
3. Missionaries & Cannibals	Constrained Search (BFS)	(M_left, C_left, Boat_pos)	(0, 0, 0)	Valid transitions where 
M

C
 or

4. Rule-Based Decision Making	Production System / Expert System	Fact dictionary / Set	Matching condition triggers recommendation	Forward-chaining pattern match
Unit 2: Heuristic Search Algorithms
1. Maze Solver (BFS)
Problem Formulation
Given a 2D grid where 0 is a walkable tile and 1 is an obstacle wall, find the shortest escape path from a start coordinate to an end coordinate.

Algorithm
Enqueue the initial position path: [(start_r, start_c)].
Pop the front path. Inspect the endpoint.
Check 4-directional moves (Up, Down, Left, Right).
If a neighbor is inside grid bounds, not a wall (0), and unvisited, enqueue path + [neighbor].
Repeat until the destination coordinate is popped.
2. Graph Traversal (DFS)
Problem Formulation
Explore deeply down each branch before backtracking to uncover all connected nodes in an arbitrary graph.

Algorithm
Mark the current node as visited and record it.
For each adjacent neighbor:
If the neighbor has not been visited, recursively invoke DFS on it.
Backtrack once all branches from the current node are exhausted.
3. Route Planning (Greedy Best-First Search)
Problem Formulation
Find a route between cities using estimated remaining distance to the goal as a heuristic guide.

Evaluation Function
f
(
n
)
=
h
(
n
)

h
(
n
)
: Estimated straight-line distance (SLD) from city 
n
 to the target.
The algorithm expands whichever valid neighbor appears closest to the goal, disregarding accumulated travel cost

.
4. 8-Puzzle Problem (

 for every misplaced tile.
Priority queue expands states with the lowest combined
